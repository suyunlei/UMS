Our research focuses on quantitative analysis of urban morphology, spatial structure, and urban evolution. We utilize advanced data analysis, simulation, and modeling techniques to explore how cities grow and transform, aiming to provide support for sustainable urban development and planning.

Main research directions include:
- Urban Morphology & Urban Activities
- Human-Perceived Urban Space
- AI for Urban Evaluation & Redevelopment
