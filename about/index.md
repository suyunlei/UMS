# About us

Urban Morphology Studio (UMS) focuses on urban morphology as its core framework, integrating cutting-edge quantitative methods such as big data analytics, geographic information science (GIS), and artificial intelligence (AI). By adopting a multidisciplinary perspective that spans social, economic, geographic, ecological, and environmental dimensions, the studio conducts comprehensive research on urban space. We are committed to observing, understanding, and enhancing both the built and lived environments to foster more equitable, livable, and sustainable urban spaces.

## Our Mission

We are committed to identifying and addressing issues in urban spaces such as poor spatial experiences, lack of equity, and inefficient resource allocation. Guided by the principle of human-centered design, we employ quantitative methods to explore and evaluate strategies for urban renewal, with the goal of enhancing the experiences and overall quality of life for city residents.

UMS advocates for inclusive participation and collaborative innovation. We engage with a wide range of stakeholders—including urban residents, policymakers, planning and design professionals, and developers—to understand diverse perspectives and reshape urban environments that are more equitable, livable, resilient, and sustainable.

## Join us

UMS Urban Morphology Studio warmly welcomes students from diverse academic backgrounds who are passionate about urban issues. We emphasize interdisciplinary collaboration and knowledge co-creation, and advocate for a mentorship model grounded in mutual learning. Our goal is to foster a healthy, equitable, and open research environment built on respectful and supportive relationships between faculty and students.

Supported by the Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)’s advanced research infrastructure and international academic ecosystem, we offer our members robust resources—ranging from high-performance computing facilities to well-equipped workspaces and a quality living environment. We sincerely invite aspiring scholars committed to urban spatial research and innovation to join us in shaping the future of our lab.
